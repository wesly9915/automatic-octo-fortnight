;;;; This file is project 0 for CS 314 for Spring 2022, taught by Prof. Francisco
;;;; The assignment is to fill in the definitions below, adding your code where ever
;;;; you see the comment 
     ;;  replace this line
;;;; to make each function do what its comments say it should do.  You
;;;; may replace such a line with as many lines as you want to.  You may
;;;; also add your own functions, as long as each function has a
;;;; comment like the ones below.  You may not make any other changes
;;;; to this code.
;;;; see end of file for some examples that will run ONCE THE FUNCTION add-check
;;;; IS FILLED IN
;;;; See the assignment on Sakai for more examples (these may require
;;;; more than add-check to be filled in) and further information,
;;;; including due date.
;;;; code for a program to create closures that generate figures out
;;;; of characters.
;;; figures: a figure is represented by a list of 3 elements: func,
;;; numrows, and numcols where:
;;;   func is a function (ie a closure) of two parameters: row, column
;;;     that returns the character at the given row and column of the
;;;     figure.  If row is out of bounds ie row<0 or row>=numrows, or
;;;     similarly for col, func returns the character #\. (a period
;;;     character)
;;;   numrows is the number of rows in the figure
;;;   numcols is the number of columns in the figure
;;; The following are functions to create and access a figure. Note that
;;; make-figure adds bounds checking to func
(define (make-figure func numrows numcols)
    (list (add-check func numrows numcols) numrows numcols))
(define (figure-func figure) (car figure))
(define (figure-numrows figure)(cadr figure))
(define (figure-numcols figure)(caddr figure))
;;; forn takes three arguments:  start and stop, which are numbers, and func 
;;; which is a function of one argument.
;;; forn calls func several times, first with the argument start, then with start+1
;;; then ... finally with stop.  It returns a list of the values of the calls. 
;;; If start>stop, forn simply returns the empty list without doing any calls to func.
(define (forn start stop func)
  (if (> start stop) '()
      (let ((first-value (func start)))
        (cons first-value (forn (+ 1 start) stop func)))))
;;; range-check takes 4 arguments:  row, numrows, col, numcols It checks if
;;;  0 <= row < numrows and similarly for col and numcols.  If both row and col are in 
;;;  range, range-check returns #t.  If either are out of range, rangecheck  returns #f
(define (range-check row numrows col numcols)
  (not (or (< row 0) (< col 0) (>= row numrows) (>= col numcols))))
;;; add-check takes 3 arguments: func, numrows and numcols.  func is a
;;; function of two numbers, row and col.  add-check returns a new
;;; function, which we will refer to here as func2.  Like func, func2 takes
;;; a row number and a column number as arguments. func2 first calls
;;; range-check to do a range check on these numbers against numrows
;;; and numcols. If row or col is out of range func2 returns #\.,
;;; otherwise it returns the result of (func row col).    can think of
;;; func2 as a "safe" version of func, like the function returned by
;;; null-safe in Resources > Langauge_Info > Scheme > null-safe.scm except that a
;;; "bad", i.e. out of range, argument to func here will not necessarily
;;; crash scheme the way (car '( )) would.
